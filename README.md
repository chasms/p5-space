Bread crumbs:

- JavaScript's class syntax lets you write object-oriented sketches
- p5.js has a TON of built-in events
- Use Async / Await to hook into an API and turn this into a data viz project, or let it influence your art more generally

Project Ideas:

- Art / canvas projects - something that lets you draw, create, or mutate images in response to user input.

Unlocked at Part 2:

- Video filters that add shapes (think clown nose on your nose maybe? or moustache?)
- Video filters that manipulate the image data (e.g. black-and-white image? An image with augmented blue?)
